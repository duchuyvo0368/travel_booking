## üöÄ Technology Stack

### Backend Technologies
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, allowing for fast and scalable network applications. It's designed to build server-side applications and APIs.
- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications, allowing for easy routing and middleware integration.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. This allows for dynamic schema designs and is perfect for handling complex data structures in travel bookings.
- **RabbitMQ**: An open-source message broker that facilitates the communication between services in a decoupled manner, enabling better scalability and reliability of messaging.
- **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker. It provides high performance for data retrieval and is utilized for caching and session management in this application.
- **Cloudinary**: A cloud-based service for managing images and videos, allowing easy storage, manipulation, and delivery of media assets.

### Libraries and Frameworks
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for secure user authentication and authorization, allowing for stateless sessions and preventing unauthorized access to protected routes.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a straightforward way to model and interact with MongoDB data.
- **Nodemailer**: A module for Node.js to send emails easily, utilized in the notification service for sending booking confirmations and reminders.
- **dotenv**: A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`, enabling configuration management for different environments.
